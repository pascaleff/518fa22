* Course outline

  - *Description:* Differentiable manifolds are a class of spaces that
    includes Euclidean spaces, smooth curves and surfaces in 3-space,
    higher-dimensional generalizations such as the $n$ dimensional
    spheres, and infinitely much more. Manifolds locally look like open
    sets in Euclidean space, but they may have a nontrivial global
    topology. A differentiable manifold is one where, at least locally,
    we can "do multivariable calculus" in a meaningful way. This local
    structure has consequences for the global topology. Even for
    Euclidean spaces (whose global topology is trivial) the theory of
    manifolds provides a new perspective on geometry that vastly
    generalizes traditional Euclidean geometry in multiple directions.

    The foundations of differentiable manifolds are not particularly
    simple, but they support a theory that has a lot of intuitive
    appeal. One goal of this course is to convey both the technical
    foundations and the intuitive picture.

  - *Lectures:* Lectures will be held in person.

  - *Assessment:* Grades will be based on homework (25%), a midterm
    exams (25%), and the final exam (50%). The two lowest homework
    scores will be dropped.

  - *Homework:* There will be weekly homework assignments whose due
    dates are listed in the schedule. Homework should be submitted on
    paper in class. If you are unable to come to class, you may turn
    in your homework to James Pascaleff's mailbox in the mailroom, 250
    Altgeld Hall.

  - *Exams:* There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. The
    midterm exam will be held in class TBD. The final exam date and
    time are TBD.

* Policies

  - *Collaboration and Academic Integrity:* For homework assignments,
    collaboration is permitted and expected, but you must write up
    your solutions individually and understand them completely. On
    exams, no collaboration is permitted.

  - *Disability accommodations:* Students who require special
    accommodations should contact the instructor as soon as
    possible. Any accommodations on exams must be requested at least
    one week in advance and will require a letter from DRES.

* Homework assignments

  - Optional homework: Watch this [[http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/Videos/IMS/Differential_Topology/][series of lectures on Differential
    Topology]] by John Milnor. Many of the ideas presented in these
    lectures will be covered in this course.

  - *Homework 1 due Friday, September 2*
    + Fernandes, p. 11: problems 4, 5.
    + Fernandes, p. 18-19: problems 1, 4, 5, 7, 9.

* Schedule
  This schedule is a tentative outline of the topics that we will cover. 
  Section numbers refer to [[https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~ruiloja/Meus-papers/HTML/notesDG.pdf][Fernandes' notes]].
  As the semester progresses, this schedule will mutate into a log of what was covered in each lecture.
